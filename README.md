# About
Utilizing both Python and R, we attempted to create a logistic regression that would predict whether a link is actually a phishing attempt.

- The Jupyter notebook houses our compiled results, however, the R code was also attached for reference.
- We created a Logistic regression with 92% accuracy in both R and Python.

## Collaborators
